# Lab-1 

## Task
Implement a sorting algorithm - HeapSort(ascending/descending)

## Result output
- Algorithm's name
- Execution time
- Counters: swaps, comparisons
- Sorting result

## Code must be covered with tests
- sort the input array
- sort in ascending order of sorted array in ascending order
- sort in descending order of sorted array in ascending order
- sort in ascending order of sorted array in descending order
- sort in descending order of sorted array in descending order
